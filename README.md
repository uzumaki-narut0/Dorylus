# BlogChain
Blogchain is a decentralized, server-less blogging app built on top of the *Ethereum* platform. It leverages *IPFS* (Inter Planetory File System), *Metamask* and *web3.js* to build a **WEB 3.0** app. It gives you the ownership of your content and a platform where you can incentivize your writing skills. 
Viewers can tip off the writers for the blogs they published. The platform establishes its own custom *ERC20* token **Tsukiyomi** to rally the community around.
